## Name Conventions
### Objects
Blender objects should be named with the most accurate representation of what they are.
They should be postfixed with their number count to the 3rd decimal place, starting at zero.

Template: <object name>.<count>
For example, a single "shoe" would be "shoe.000", two shoe objects would be "shoe.000" and "shoe.001"

### Vector Groups
Blender vector groups should be named with the most accurate representation of what the vector group contains.
Vector groups should be prefix with the object name, hyphenated then the vector group name, followed by a postfix of the group count.
Blender vertex groups should be postfxied with their number count to the 3rd decimal place, starting at zero.

Template: <object name>-<vector-group>.<count>
For example, a single "shoe heel" would be "shoe-heel.000", two shoe objects would be "shoe-heel.000" and "shoe-heel.001"
